ansible-from-push-to-pull
=========================

How we have transitioned from a push to pull for provisioning and deployment without leaving Ansible. In this talk I will discuss our change from using Ansbile in push mode to Ansible to pull mode. I will talk about the motivations behind moving to a pull mode and compromises of leaving a push based methodology.
